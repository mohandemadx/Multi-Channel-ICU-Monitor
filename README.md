# Multi-Port, Multi-Channel Signal Viewer

## Introduction
Monitoring vital signals is crucial in any ICU room. This desktop application, developed using Python and Qt, allows users to visualize multi-port, multi-channel signals with various features.

## Features

### Signal File Handling
- Browse PC to open any signal file.

### Graph Functionality
- Two main identical graphs with independent controls.
- Link graphs for synchronization.
- Cine mode for running signals, with rewind option.
- Independent or linked operation of graphs.

### User Interface Elements
