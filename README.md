# Multi-Port, Multi-Channel ICU Monitor

## Introduction
Monitoring vital signals is crucial in any ICU room. This desktop application, developed using Python and Qt, allows users to visualize multi-port, multi-channel signals with various features.

## Features

### Signal File Handling
- Browse PC to open any signal file.

### Graph Functionality
- Two main identical graphs with independent controls.
- Link graphs for synchronization.
- Cine mode for running signals, with rewind option.
- Independent or linked operation of graphs.

### User Interface Elements
- Manipulate running signals with UI elements:
  - Change color
  - Add label/title for each signal
  - Show/hide signals
  - Control/customize cine speed
  - Zoom in/out
  - Pause/play/rewind
  - Scroll/Pan signals in any direction

### Exporting & Reporting
- Construct reports with snapshots and data statistics.
- Generate PDF contents programmatically.
- Include mean, std, duration, min, and max values in a well-organized table.
- Single or multi-page reports for different signal and snapshot scenarios.
